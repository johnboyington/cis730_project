# cis730_project
This repository containes the scripts used in my cis730 artificial intelligence project.


The high-level script used to generate the data for this project is located at:

`agents/defeat_roaches/defeat_roaches.py`

and can be invoked in the following way:

`python defeat_roaches.py log`

to run the scripted bot and

`python defeat_roaches.py learn`

to run the neural network.


Dependencies include everything needed to use `pysc2` which can be found at 
https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2.

My presentation pdf can be found in
`doc/presentation`

and the report is located in
`doc/report`.
